This is a simple raycasting program written in javascript.  It displays two canvases, one shows a topdown view of the "level" map,
with the player shown as a red circle and a green cone denoting the ray paths that correspond to the player's view in a 3d world.
The second canvas shows the actual 3d view, with blue walls and a black floor and ceiling.
The arrow keys can be used to move around in the 3d view, the sprite will move in the 2D top view as well.
This was a very simple exercise by me to learn about raycasting and drawing in the html canvas.
I based this on the "Make Your Own Raycaster Part 1" tutorial by 3DSage on youtube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYRrGTC7GtA
His tutorial is in C++ using SDL, and has subsequent parts the allow for more features.  I might get around to recreating
this in C++ at some point, as the HTML canvas is pretty limited compared to what SDL can do.  
Anyway, this was fun and makes for a neat little app.
